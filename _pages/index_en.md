**Silo – Art and Rural Latitude** is a Civil Society Organisation of Public Interest dedicated to fostering and publicising cultural projects in rural areas, with the aim of bringing about transdisciplinary exchange between different areas – above all art, the sciences and technologies – and stimulating exchange between intuitive techniques and scientific knowledge.

We are currently based in Serrinha do Alambari, an APA (Environmental Protection Area), located in the municipality of Resende, in Rio de Janeiro State, on the eastern slopes of Itatiaia National Park, in the Mantiqueira Mountain Range. Our activities encompass local and international communities.
