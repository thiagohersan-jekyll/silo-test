Silo organises Resilience: Artist in Residence, which is a programme with an international call for participants. The residency offers artists and curators space and other resources for creation and experimentation. On this programme we offer financial support  for the development of artistic works. Every year we hold an exhibition with artists in residence, guests and publish a catalogue.
