Through the CaipiraTechLab programme we offer courses, workshops and other activities on themes related to agroecology, agroforestry systems, bioarchitecture and energy generation, among others. We also offer assistance on the building of infrastructure and the carrying out of educational activities in rural areas. We count on a network of professionals who are extremely well-qualified and committed to environmental issues.
